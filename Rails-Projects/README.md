This is a list of projects used to learn Rails

"cat app" is a website similar to 99-dresses that let's you rent cats. We had more practice with rails and with creating a User Auth from scratch.

Music App is an app to keep inventory of bands, albums and tracks and was more practice with rails routes and forms.

We made a reddit clone to practice making nested comments with associations between comments, other comments, and posts, and optimized queries to the database.

We made a goal app that let users create goals. The focus of this project was on doing test-driven development and writing RSpec tests first.
