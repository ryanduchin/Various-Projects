This is a portfolio of work done at App Academy (Mar-June 2015). These were largely given as assignments and were curated to advance learning of these subjects.

I have divided the work into subfolders of the different curriculums.

For the most part, this work is not polished. Some projects may be unfinished and broken while other projects are functional. However, I think it demonstrates exposure to many of these topics and I am leaving it on this github for anyone who may be interested.
