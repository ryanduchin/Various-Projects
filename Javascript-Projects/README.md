This is a list of projects used to learn Javascript.

Intro day was a list of simple exercises to learn the new language.

w5d5 exercises included making the game logic of TicTacToe and Towers of Hanoi, as well as some other problems such as a variation of bubble sort.

On w6d3 we used jquery to create a playable version of tic tac toe and towers of hanoi. These are playable in the skeleton > html > index.html folders

We made a bare-bones game of Asteroids using canvas on w6d1. The game is rather incomplete but I took the ideas I learned and created my own ski game which is in my github portfolio.

We learned and practiced CSS by trying to copy a facebook-esque template on w6d2.

We learned about and created jquery plugins on w6d4 and made an image carousel, thumbnail image viewer, and tabs showing different views.
